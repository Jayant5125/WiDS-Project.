# WIDS: Neural Voyage

Hey guys, let's begin with the project!

You guys need to do two assignments this week, which include basic usage of numpy, pandas and matplotlib, which you will be using a lot throughout the project. All the necessary resources have been added in the Week 1 README file. You are encouraged to explore on your own too if you get done with these.

We will soon be adding tasks for Week 2 involving implementation of Linear and Logistic Regression techniques
